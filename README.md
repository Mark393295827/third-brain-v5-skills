**Third Brain V5 — 19 production-ready Agent Skills for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, and Windsurf. Build a persistent Knowledge OS with Obsidian, behavior design, creativity loops, verification, full-stack agent harnesses, multi-agent workflows, and AI operations quality systems.**

Install 19 ready-to-use Agent Skills for ingesting sources, building an interlinked wiki, running daily review loops, verifying claims, managing context cost, engineering bounded agent loops, improving agent workflows, orchestrating agent teams, and designing AI Six Sigma operations.

**Use this if your AI coding agent keeps forgetting context, making unverifiable "done" claims, or scattering useful knowledge across chats. Star it if you want a reusable, verification-first skill stack for long-running AI work.**

## Quick Install

![Install demo](assets/install-demo.svg)

For Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mark393295827/third-brain-v5-skills.git
cd third-brain-v5-skills
bash install.sh
```

Explicit targets:

```bash
bash install.sh codex
bash install.sh claude
bash install.sh gemini
bash install.sh cursor
bash install.sh windsurf
bash install.sh all
```

```

## Try It

Paste one of these into your agent after installing:

```text
"I just read an interesting article. Ingest it into my wiki."
"Run my daily OKR."
"Cognitive compile on AI agent safety."
"Verify before I ship."
"Create an agent team to build a full-stack prototype."
```

One-click test prompt: [examples/one-click-test-prompt.md](examples/one-click-test-prompt.md).

## 3-Minute Quick Start

The fastest useful path is `wiki-ingest`: turn one article, PDF, transcript, or rough note into durable wiki knowledge. Treat this as the recommended first skill; add the rest only after the previous layer is producing evidence.

```text
Use wiki-ingest on this source.

Goal: turn it into reusable wiki knowledge, not a loose summary.

Create:
1. one immutable source note in `SOURCES_DIR` (default: `sources/`)
2. 3-7 key insights with source references
3. at least one concept page in `CONCEPTS_DIR` (default: `wiki/concepts/`)
4. relevant entity pages in `ENTITIES_DIR` (default: `wiki/entities/`)
5. links from the new pages to existing related pages when possible
6. a short log entry in `LOG_FILE` (default: `system/log.md`)

After writing files, run a quick verification:
- list created or updated files
- check each wiki page has at least two wikilinks
- state any claims that are single-source only
```

Full copyable workflow: [examples/3-minute-quickstart.md](examples/3-minute-quickstart.md).

## Skill Adoption Ladder

| Stage | Core skills | Upgrade when |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1: Start | `wiki-ingest` + `verify-before-claim` | You can ingest at least one source per day and every completion claim has fresh evidence. |
| Weeks 2-4: Daily loop | + `daily-okr` + `session-learn` | Daily OKR score is above 70% for a week and session learnings are being written back. |
| Month 2+: Deepen | + `cognitive-compile` + `behavior-design` + `creativity-engine` | The wiki has 50+ pages or repeated decisions need deeper synthesis and experiments. |
| Month 3+: Engineer | + `knowledge-ops` + `harness-engineering` + `agentic-engineering` | Retrieval, permissions, delegated actions, provenance, or workflow reliability become bottlenecks. |
| Multi-agent: Scale | + `agent-teams-command` + `project-flow-ops` | Work can be split into separate owners with clear integration and verification gates. |
| Strategy: Evaluate | + `startup-evaluation` + `anthropic-os` + `deep-research` | You need startup health, market, operating-system, or STOW-compatible evidence research decisions. |
| Operations: Control | + `ai-six-sigma-property-os` | You need measurable service quality, dispatch, quote, evidence, and workflow control loops. |

## Before → After

| Use Case | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Research PDF | A long PDF is summarized once and then forgotten. | `wiki-ingest` creates source notes, concept pages, entity pages, links, and a reusable brief. |
| Coding session | The agent says "fixed" without proof. | `verify-before-claim` requires a fresh command, exit code, and evidence before any completion claim. |
| Daily knowledge work | Inputs, ideas, and actions stay scattered across chat history. | `daily-okr` produces one insight, one wiki update, one action, one reusable output, and a daily score. |

## Overview

These skills transform any AI coding agent into a **persistent knowledge compounding system**. Instead of treating each conversation as a one-off chat, these skills create an interlinked knowledge base that grows richer with every session — while also providing strategic execution frameworks inspired by Anthropic's work methods and Karpathy's Agentic Engineering.

### Agent Understanding Framework

Third Brain treats agents as LLM OS processes, not chat personas: the LLM is the CPU, context is RAM, Obsidian/wiki/logs are disk, tools are system calls, skills are executable programs, and the harness is the kernel that enforces permissions and observability. See [Agent Understanding Framework](wiki/concepts/agent-understanding-framework.md).

The latest engineering update adds a full-stack agent lens: agent workflows now account for IDE subagents, personal agents, agentic search, commerce mandates, generative-media provenance, and ambient-device privacy. See [Agentic Engineering Principles](docs/agentic-engineering-principles.md).

### Design Philosophy

| Layer | Principle | Skills |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **🧠 Knowledge** | Capture, structure, and compound knowledge over time | wiki-ingest, knowledge-ops, wiki-lint |
| **⚡ Daily Loop** | Close the knowledge-to-action cycle every day | daily-okr, cognitive-compile |
| **🎯 Behavior & Creativity** | Turn knowledge into habits and novel ideas | behavior-design, creativity-engine |
| **🔬 Research & Quality** | Verify before claiming, research with rigor | deep-research, verify-before-claim |
| **🔄 Continuous Learning** | Extract patterns from every session | session-learn, project-flow-ops |
| **📊 Context & Cost** | Manage the LLM's scarcest resource | context-manager, token-cost-tracker |
| **🏗️ Engineering** | Design bounded loops, agent workflows, infrastructure, and multi-agent teams | loop-engineering, agentic-engineering, harness-engineering, agent-teams-command |
| **💼 Strategy & Operations** | Evaluate startups, adopt Anthropic-level methods, and design AI quality systems | startup-evaluation, anthropic-os, ai-six-sigma-property-os |

## Wiki Structure

These skills use `system/config.md` as the default path contract. The layout below is the default, not a hard requirement; override it in your local `system/config.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent agent rules file if your Obsidian vault already uses different folders.

```
sources/          ← Immutable source notes (articles, books, reports)
wiki/
├── concepts/     ← Ideas, frameworks, methods
├── entities/     ← People, companies, products
├── atomic-notes/ ← Single knowledge atoms
├── outputs/      ← Reusable outputs (reports, analyses, evaluations)
├── decisions/    ← Architecture and strategy decisions
└── sops/         ← Standard operating procedures
maps/             ← Navigation / Maps of Content
system/           ← Schema, log, templates, lint reports
08_behaviors/     ← Behavior system (goals, habits, SOPs, reviews)
09_creativity/    ← Creativity system (ideas, experiments, prototypes)
```

Path config: [system/config.md](system/config.md).
